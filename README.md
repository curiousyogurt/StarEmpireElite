# Star Empire Elite

Star Empire Elite is a turn-based strategy game where you found and manage a galactic empire. Acquire planets, manage resources, conduct diplomacy, and use covert operations to create a galactic dynasty.

# Details

Star Empire Elite is a modern reimagining of the classic BBS door game Space Dynasty (by Hollie Satterfield). Space Dynasty itself was inspired by Space Empire Elite (by Jon Radoff) and Galactic Empire (by Andromeda Software).

## The Original Games 💡

These games defined a generation of BBS gaming in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Players would dial into bulletin board systems, play their turns (typically 4-6 per day), and compete asynchronously with other players on the same BBS.

## Core Gameplay 🎲

In Star Empire Elite, you command a galactic empire with the goal of becoming the largest power. Acquire planets through purchase or conquest, manage your economy, build military fleets, form alliances, conduct diplomacy, and use covert operations to destabilize rival empires.

## Turn-Based System 🎉

The game operates on a turn-based system where each player receives a fixed number of turns per day. On each turn, you manage planet maintenance, buy and sell food, conduct covert operations, purchase military units, attack other empires, and send diplomatic messages.

## The Radoffian Dynasty 👑

Beware the computer-controlled Radoffian Dynasty! This powerful AI opponent has special abilities including seizing planets without attacking and hijacking fuel freighters.

## Technology 🖥

This remake is built entirely in Clojure, a powerful Lisp dialect very much like Racket, using a purely functional approach with modern web technologies.
